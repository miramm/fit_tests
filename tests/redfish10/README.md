##RackHD Redfish API 1.0Test harness

    These scripts test the 'northbound' Redfish 1.0 API
    API tests are intended to verify that APIs meet the following:
        - proper parsing of API, options, and payloads
        - proper return status codes
        - proper JSON returned data
    API tests are not intended for detailed functional testing and are usually included in Smoke tests.
