## RackHD API 1.1 Test Harness

    These scripts test the RackHD 1.1 API.
    API tests are intended to verify that APIs meet the following:
        - proper parsing of API, options, and payloads
        - proper return status codes
        - proper JSON returned data
    API tests are not intended for detailed functional testing and are usually included in Smoke tests.
