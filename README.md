# FIT Test Overview

The FIT test suite is an open-source testing harness for RackHD and OnRack software.
RackHD/OnRack (https://github.com/RackHD) is the open-sourced Hardware Management and Orchestration
software developed by EMC for datacenter administration.

FIT stands for Functional Integration Tests and is intended for Continuous Integration testing
as well as standalone testing. It was originally developed by the EMC OnRack test group to provide
the RackHD community a flexible test and deployment toolset that will work in a variety of
valid configurations and environments.

FIT is written in Python 2.7 'unittest' and uses Nose (nosetests) as the test runner.

# Running FIT

## Requirements and Setup

FIT tests are intended to be run on Ubuntu 14+ Linux.
Test harness may be run on appliance host (localhost), or third party machine.
Deployment scripts must be run under third party Ubuntu Linux host.
Tests require the following virtual environment commands be executed:

    virtualenv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Organization

- 'tests' is the test 'harness'
- 'common' contains any common library functions
- 'deploy' contains deployment and installation scripts
- 'templates' contains script templates for making new tests
- 'util' contains non-test utilities

## Configuration

Local runtime parameters are set from the 'config/global_config.json' file.
Stack definitions are set from the 'config/stack_config.json' file.
An alternate configuration directory can be selected using the -config argument.
More details in config/README.mg.

## Running the tests

All FIT tests can be run from the wrapper 'run_tests.py':

    usage: run_tests.py [-h] [-test TEST] [-config CONFIG] [-group GROUP]
                        [-stack STACK] [-ora ORA] [-version VERSION] [-xunit]
                        [-list] [-sku SKU] [-obmmac OBMMAC | -nodeid NODEID]
                        [-v V]

    Command Help

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -test TEST        test to execute, default: tests/
      -config CONFIG    config file location, default: fit_tests/config
      -group GROUP      test group to execute: 'smoke', 'regression', 'extended',
                        default: 'all'
      -stack STACK      stack label (test bed), overrides -ora
      -ora ORA          OnRack/RackHD appliance IP address or hostname, default:
                        localhost
      -version VERSION  OnRack version, example:onrack-release-0.3.0, default:
                        onrack-devel
      -xunit            generates xUnit XML report files
      -list             generates test list only
      -sku SKU          node SKU, example:Phoenix, default=all
      -obmmac OBMMAC    node OBM MAC address, example:00:1e:67:b1:d5:64,
                        default=all
      -nodeid NODEID    node identifier string of a discovered node, example:
                        56ddcf9a8eff16614e79ec74
      -v V              Verbosity level of console output, default=0, Built Ins:
                        0: No debug, 2: User script output, 4: rest calls and
                        status info, 6: other common calls (ipmi, ssh), 9: all the
                        rest

This example will run the RackHD installer onto stack 1 via the wrapper script:

    ./run_tests.py -stack 1 -test autotest/run_rackhd_installer.py

Alternatively tests can be run directly from nose. Runtime parameters such as ORA address must be set in the environment.

The following example will run all the entire test harness from a third party machine to ORA at 192.168.1.1:

    export ORA=192.168.1.1
    nosetests -s tests


## Running individual tests

Individual test scripts or tests may be executed using the following 'Nose' addressing scheme:

    test_script_path:classname.testname


For example, to run the test 'test_rackhd11_api_catalogs' in script 'tests/rackhd11/test_rackhd11_api_catalogs.py' on stack 1:

    python run_tests.py -stack 11 -test tests/rackhd11/test_rackhd11_api_catalogs.py:test_rackhd11_api_catalogs.test_api_11_catalogs


## Test conventions

- Tests should be written using Python 'unittest' classes and methods.
- Tests should utilize common library functions for API and appliance shell access.
- Tests should leave the DUT(Device Under Test) in the same state that it was found. For example, if the test creates a node, then delete it.
The setUp and tearDown methods are useful ways to setup and clean out test-specific conditions.
- Tests should have meaningful names that relate to its function.
- If tests need to be run in a sequence, use numbered class and method names 'test01'. 'test02', etc.
- If scripts need to run in a sequence, use a wrapper script and number the method names.
- Tests that need specific conditions should be run in a single script and utilize 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods.
- Tests should not have any direct references to IP addresses or hostnames. Use GLOBAL_CONFIG or STACK_CONFIG for hardware or resource references.
